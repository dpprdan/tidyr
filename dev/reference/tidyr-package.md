# tidyr: Tidy Messy Data

Tools to help to create tidy data, where each column is a variable, each
row is an observation, and each cell contains a single value. 'tidyr'
contains tools for changing the shape (pivoting) and hierarchy (nesting
and 'unnesting') of a dataset, turning deeply nested lists into
rectangular data frames ('rectangling'), and extracting values out of
string columns. It also includes tools for working with missing values
(both implicit and explicit).
