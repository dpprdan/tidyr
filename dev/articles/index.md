### Tidying tools

- [Pivoting](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.md):

  Learn how use the new
  [`pivot_longer()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/pivot_longer.md)
  and
  [`pivot_wider()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/pivot_wider.md)
  functions which change the representation of a dataset without
  changing the data it contains.

- [Rectangling](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/rectangle.md):

  Rectangling is the art and craft of taking a deeply nested list (often
  sourced from wild caught JSON or XML) and taming it into a tidy data
  set of rows and columns. This vignette introduces you to the main
  rectangling tools provided by tidyr:
  [`unnest_longer()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/unnest_longer.md),
  [`unnest_wider()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/unnest_wider.md),
  and [`hoist()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/hoist.md).

- [Nested data](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/nest.md):

  A nested data frame contains a list-column of data frames. It’s an
  alternative way of representing grouped data, that works particularly
  well when you’re modelling.

### Theory

- [Tidy data](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/tidy-data.md):

  A tidy dataset has variables in columns, observations in rows, and one
  value in each cell. This vignette introduces the theory of “tidy data”
  and shows you how it saves you time during data analysis.

### Developer

- [Programming with
  tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/programming.md):

  Notes on programming with tidy evaluation as it relates to tidyr.

- [In
  packages](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/in-packages.md):

  Things to bear in mind when using tidyr in a package.
